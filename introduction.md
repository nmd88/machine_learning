# Machine Learning Introduction

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a system that can learn from example through self-improvement and without being explicitly coded by programmer. 
The breakthrough comes with the idea that a machine can singularly learn from the data (i.e., example) to produce accurate results.

Machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output. 
This output is then used by corporate to makes actionable insights. 
Machine learning is closely related to data mining and Bayesian predictive modeling. 
The machine receives data as input, use an algorithm to formulate answers.

A typical machine learning tasks are to provide a recommendation. 
For those who have a Netflix account, all recommendations of movies or series are based on the user's historical data. 
Tech companies are using unsupervised learning to improve the user experience with personalizing recommendation.

Machine learning is also used for a variety of task like fraud detection, predictive maintenance, portfolio optimization, automatize task and so on.
