# <a name="torch"></a> 1. Torch
Torch is an old open source machine learning library. It is first released was 15 years ago. It is primary programming languages is LUA, but has an implementation in C. Torch supports a vast library for machine learning algorithms, including deep learning. It supports CUDA implementation for parallel computation.

Torch is used by most of the leading labs such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Nvidia, and so on. Torch has a library in Python names Pytorch.

# <a name="Infer.net"></a> 2. Infer.net
Infer.net is developed and maintained by Microsoft. Infer.net is a library with a primary focus on the Bayesian statistic. Infer.net is designed to offer practitioners state-of-the-art algorithms for probabilistic modeling. The library contains analytical tools such as Bayesian analysis, hidden Markov chain, clustering.

# <a name="Keras"></a> 3. Keras
Keras is a Python framework for deep learning. It is a convenient library to construct any deep learning algorithm. The advantage of Keras is that it uses the same Python code to run on CPU or GPU. Besides, the coding environment is pure and allows for training state-of-the-art algorithm for computer vision, text recognition among other.

Keras has been developed by François Chollet, a researcher at Google. Keras is used in prominent organizations like CERN, Yelp, Square or Google, Netflix, and Uber.

# <a name="Theano"></a> 4. Theano
Theano is deep learning library developed by the Université de Montréal in 2007. It offers fast computation and can be run on both CPU and GPU. Theano has been developed to train deep neural network algorithms.

# <a name="CNTK"></a> 5. MICROSOFT COGNITIVE TOOLKIT(CNTK)
Microsoft toolkit, previously know as CNTK, is a deep learning library developed by Microsoft. According to Microsoft, the library is among the fastest on the market. Microsoft toolkit is an open-source library, although Microsoft is using it extensively for its product like Skype, Cortana, Bing, and Xbox. The toolkit is available both in Python and C++.

# <a name="MXNet"></a> 6. MXNet
MXnet is a recent deep learning library. It is accessible with multiple programming languages including C++, Julia, Python and R. MXNet can be configured to work on both CPU and GPU. MXNet includes state-of-the-art deep learning architecture such as Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory. MXNet is build to work in harmony with dynamic cloud infrastructure. The main user of MXNet is Amazon

# <a name="Caffe"></a> 7. Caffe
Caffe is a library built by Yangqing Jia when he was a PhD student at Berkeley. Caffe is written in C++ and can perform computation on both CPU and GPU. The primary uses of Caffe is Convolutional Neural Network. Although, In 2017, Facebook extended Caffe with more deep learning architecture, including Recurrent Neural Network. caffe is used by academics and startups but also some large companies like Yahoo!.

# <a name="TensorFlow"></a> 8. TensorFlow
TensorFlow is Google open source project. TensorFlow is the most famous deep learning library these days. It was released to the public in late 2015.

TensorFlow is developed in C++ and has convenient Python API, although C++ APIs are also available. Prominent companies like Airbus, Google, IBM and so on are using TensorFlow to produce deep learning algorithms.
